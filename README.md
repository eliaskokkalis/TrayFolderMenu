# TrayFolderMenu
The taskbar in Windows 11 does not provide the ability to create toolbars. This simple application can be used as a substitute of this missing functionality.

It displays a folder icon in the taskbar notification area. Double click on the icon to show the configuration form where you can set the toolbar folders. Right click on the icon to show the toolbar menus.
